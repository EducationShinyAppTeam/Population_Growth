Chapter: Biology 
Description: This app explores how growth rate, carrying capacity, density-independent limiting factors, and density-dependent limiting factors, affects the growth and variability of a hypothetical population of rabbits.
LearningObjectives: c(
    "The student will learn to explore the differences in deterministic and stochastic growth models.",
    "The student will learn to expore how different factors influence population growth."
